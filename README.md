## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **multi-disciplinary technologist** blending strong foundations in:

- 💻 Software Engineering  
- 🛢️ Petroleum Engineering  
- 🧮 Numerical & Scientific Computing  
- 🔐 Secure Systems Architecture  

My work sits at a unique intersection:

> Building production-grade software systems **and** engineering computation tools that solve real subsurface and energy problems.

On one side, I design and deploy:

- Scalable SaaS platforms  
- Fintech & payment infrastructures  
- Enterprise dashboards  
- Secure APIs & authentication systems  

On the other, I build:

- Reservoir engineering simulators  
- Drilling visualization tools  
- Engineering education platforms  
- EOS & phase behavior sandboxes  

I’m driven by a simple philosophy:

> Translate engineering theory into interactive computational systems.
